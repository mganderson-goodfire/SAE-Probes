# SAE-Probes Reproduction Findings
*Updated: July 30, 2025*

## Executive Summary

**Paper vs. Reproduction Context**: The original paper "Are Sparse Autoencoders Useful?" concludes that SAEs show "similar results with simple non-SAE baselines" and questions their utility. Our partial reproduction on M3 MacBook Pro suggests some evidence for SAE effectiveness, particularly in OOD settings, though our analysis has important limitations.

**Key Caveat**: Our reproduction involved code modifications, used a subset of the original data, and may not fully represent the paper's complete experimental scope. Results should be interpreted with appropriate caution.

This document presents findings from our reproduction attempt of "Are Sparse Autoencoders Useful?" - we successfully trained both baseline and SAE probes for several experimental settings and can compare SAE features versus raw model activations for binary classification tasks.

## Experimental Setup

- **Model**: Gemma-2-9b
- **Layer**: 20 (primary analysis layer)
- **Hardware**: M3 MacBook Pro (Apple Silicon)
- **Environment**: Python 3.11 with uv package management
- **Analysis Date**: July 28, 2025

## Data Availability

### Baseline Probes ‚úÖ Complete
All baseline probe results are available from pre-computed data:
- **Normal setting**: 113 datasets √ó 5 methods = 565 results
- **Scarcity setting**: Complete results available
- **Class imbalance setting**: Complete results available  
- **Label noise setting**: Complete results available
- **OOD setting**: Complete results available

Methods tested: Logistic Regression, PCA+LogReg, KNN, XGBoost, MLP

### SAE Probes ‚úÖ Substantial Progress (4 of 5 Settings)
We successfully trained SAE probes for:
- **Normal setting**: 70 results (1 dataset: `5_hist_fig_ismale`) 
- **OOD setting**: 32 results (8 datasets)
- **Scarcity setting**: 8,988 results (113 datasets)
- **Class imbalance setting**: 8,588 results (113 datasets)

**Missing**: SAE probes for label_noise setting
**Limitation**: Normal setting severely undersampled compared to paper's scope

## Key Findings (With Important Caveats)

### 1. Out-of-Distribution Results - Suggestive Evidence

**Important Note**: OOD results appear promising but should be interpreted cautiously given our code modifications and potential differences from the original experimental setup.

**OOD Performance (8 datasets)**:
- All 8 datasets showed improvement with SAE probes
- Mean improvement: +0.107 AUC 
- Range: +0.042 to +0.266 AUC improvement
- **Caveat**: Sample size is small (8 datasets) and we cannot rule out systematic differences from the original study

**Potential Significance**: If confirmed with the original experimental setup, this could suggest SAE features may generalize better to new distributions, supporting interpretability claims.

### 2. Normal Setting Performance Comparison

**Dataset Analyzed**: `5_hist_fig_ismale` (gender classification from historical figures)

**Baseline Results**:
- Logistic Regression: 0.9940 AUC (best)
- PCA+LogReg: 0.9940 AUC  
- MLP: 0.9936 AUC
- XGBoost: 0.9883 AUC
- KNN: 0.9459 AUC

**SAE Results**:
- Best SAE config: 131k width, L0=221, k=512 features
- Best SAE AUC: 0.9952
- **Improvement over baseline: +0.0012 AUC**
- Success rate: 15.7% of SAE configurations beat best baseline

### 2. SAE Performance Characteristics

**Feature Selection (k) Analysis**:
- SAE probes tested with k ‚àà {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512} features
- Performance generally increases with more features (k)
- Best performance achieved with k=512 features
- Diminishing returns observed at higher k values

**SAE Configuration Analysis**:
- 7 different SAE configurations tested (varying L0 sparsity: 11-276)
- All configurations used 131k width SAEs  
- L0=221 configuration performed best with high k values
- Performance range: 0.7205 - 0.9952 AUC across all configs

### 3. Limitations and Uncertainties

**Code Modifications Made**:
- Fixed baseline training script bugs
- Optimized SAE activation generation 
- Modified memory handling for M3 MacBook Pro
- Excluded 1M width SAEs due to hardware constraints

**Data Coverage Gaps**:
- Normal setting: Only 1 dataset vs paper's full scope
- Missing label_noise SAE results entirely
- Unknown whether our OOD datasets match paper's exactly

**Experimental Differences**:
- Different hardware (M3 vs GPU cluster)
- Potential differences in random seeds/initialization
- Modified training procedures due to bug fixes

## Technical Insights

### 1. SAE Feature Selection Strategy
- SAE probes use top-k feature selection based on class mean differences
- L1 regularization applied to encourage sparsity
- Feature selection crucial for performance - raw SAE activations too sparse

### 2. Convergence Characteristics  
- Baseline training showed convergence warnings (normal for high-dimensional data)
- SAE probes trained efficiently without convergence issues
- 1000 max iterations adequate for most configurations

### 3. Memory and Performance
- 131k width SAEs manageable on M3 MacBook Pro
- 1M width SAEs hit memory limits (64GB+ RAM recommended)
- SAE activation generation was I/O bound, not compute bound
- Baseline probe training was CPU bound (multiple hyperparameter searches)

## Reproduction Quality Assessment

### ‚úÖ Successfully Reproduced
1. **Core comparison methodology**: SAE features vs raw activations
2. **Feature selection approach**: Top-k based on class differences  
3. **Regularization strategy**: L1 for SAE probes, L2 for baselines
4. **Cross-validation framework**: Appropriate for small datasets
5. **Performance metrics**: AUC, accuracy, F1 score

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
1. **Scale**: Only 1 dataset for normal setting vs 113 in full paper
2. **SAE coverage**: Missing 1M width SAEs due to memory constraints  
3. **Incomplete settings**: Missing 3 of 5 experimental conditions for SAE probes
4. **Computational resources**: Single machine vs paper's cluster resources

### üéØ Next Steps for Complete Reproduction
1. Generate SAE activations for remaining settings (scarcity, class_imbalance, label_noise)
2. Train SAE probes for these settings  
3. Extend to more datasets in normal setting
4. Access higher-memory machine for 1M width SAEs

## Paper's Central Question: "Are SAE Features Better?"

**Our Tentative Evidence** (with important caveats):

**Potentially Supportive Evidence**:
- OOD setting: Consistent improvements across all 8 datasets tested
- Large effect sizes in some cases (+0.266 AUC improvement)
- Suggests possible transferability advantages

**Limiting Evidence**:
- Normal setting: Only modest improvement (+0.0012 AUC)
- Configuration sensitivity: Most SAE configs underperform best baseline
- Small sample sizes in some experimental conditions

**Tentative Assessment**: 
Our partial reproduction suggests there may be scenarios (particularly OOD tasks) where SAE features provide meaningful advantages. However, our analysis has significant limitations including code modifications, incomplete data coverage, and potential experimental differences from the original study.

**Cannot Definitively Conclude**: Whether our results contradict or support the paper's conclusions due to methodological differences and incomplete reproduction scope.

## Conclusion - Partial Reproduction with Mixed Signals

**What We Can Say**: Our partial reproduction suggests the paper's methodology is sound and reproducible on consumer hardware. We observed some potentially interesting patterns, particularly in OOD settings, that warrant further investigation.

**What We Cannot Conclude**: Due to code modifications, incomplete data coverage, and experimental differences, we cannot definitively assess whether our results support or contradict the paper's main conclusions about SAE utility.

**Key Findings**:
1. **Methodology works**: Core experimental framework is reproducible
2. **Mixed evidence**: Some settings show SAE promise, others show modest gains
3. **Baseline strength**: Traditional methods remain competitive
4. **Setting-dependent**: Results vary significantly across experimental conditions

**Limitations of This Analysis**:
- Modified codebase may affect comparability
- Incomplete experimental coverage (missing label_noise, limited normal setting)
- Hardware differences may introduce systematic changes
- Small sample sizes in some conditions limit statistical confidence

**Recommendation**: A complete reproduction using the original, unmodified experimental setup would be needed to definitively assess the paper's conclusions about SAE utility.
